Here supervised machine learning algorithms have been used to classify the activities based on motion patterns. 
The 3 features from the dataset are used to build KNearestNeighbors and Decision Tree models. We can see that averaging results are obtained in both the models with weighted average of F1-score - 0.74 for KNN model of classifying the human activities.



Execution Instructions:
1.Please execute the notebook in Anaconda 3.0
2.All the 15 csv files of the 15 participants is the input ( same as source of the data ). In python these 15 files will be merged.
